# Linked_List

The following program features a model of a linked list. It is based of nodes that contain data, in this example I decided for the data to be an int, however it can be whatever is required, structs, objects, etc... It has functions for adding nodes, searching nodes by data, printing the list contents and removing nodes from the list. 
The list works by connecting nodes with pointers to its next node. The head node has no previous connection, while the last node has a null pointer to indicate the end of the list. This allow for iteration to be made until the last node is found. It's worth nothing that I decided not to initialize the list with a Head node, the reason for this is if the user decides that he wants to add a bunch of nodes at the same time, so the first time he does this he would only have to check if the isHead attribute is true.
