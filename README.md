# Linked_List

The following program features a model of a linked list. It is based of nodes that contain data, in this example I decided for the data to be an int, however it can be whatever is required, structs, objects, etc... It has functions for adding nodes, searching nodes by data, printing the list contents and removing nodes from the list.
